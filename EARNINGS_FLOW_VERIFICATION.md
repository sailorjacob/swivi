# Earnings & Payout Flow - Complete Verification

## ✅ VERIFIED WORKING - All Systems Operational

### 1. Initial View Capture at Submission ✅
**Location:** `app/api/clippers/submissions/route.ts` (lines 250-260)

**Flow:**
1. User submits clip URL
2. System scrapes current view count using Apify
3. Stores as `initialViews` in `ClipSubmission` table
4. This becomes the baseline for all earnings calculations

**Code:**
```typescript
const scrapedData = await scraper.scrapeContent(validatedData.clipUrl, validatedData.platform)
initialViews = scrapedData.views || 0
// ...
submission = await prisma.clipSubmission.create({
  data: {
    // ...
    initialViews: BigInt(initialViews) // BASELINE SET HERE
  }
})
```

---

### 2. Earnings Calculation ✅
**Location:** `lib/view-tracking-service.ts` (lines 142-157)

**Formula:**
```
totalViewGrowth = currentViews - initialViews
totalEarnings = (totalViewGrowth / 1000) * payoutRate
earningsToAdd = min(totalEarnings - currentEarnings, remainingBudget)
```

**Example:**
- Initial views: 100
- Current views: 5,100
- View growth: 5,000
- Payout rate: $10 CPM
- Earnings: (5,000 / 1,000) × $10 = **$50**

**Code:**
```typescript
const initialViews = Number(activeSubmission.initialViews || 0)
const totalViewGrowth = currentViews - initialViews
const payoutRate = Number(campaign.payoutRate)

const totalEarningsShouldBe = (totalViewGrowth / 1000) * payoutRate
const earningsDelta = Math.max(0, totalEarningsShouldBe - currentClipEarnings)
earningsToAdd = Math.min(earningsDelta, remainingBudget)
```

### 3. Campaign Budget Tracking ✅
**Location:** `lib/view-tracking-service.ts` (lines 187-195)

**Flow:**
1. Every time earnings are added to a clip
2. Campaign.spent is incremented by the same amount
3. When spent >= budget, campaign is automatically completed

**Code:**
```typescript
await tx.campaign.update({
  where: { id: campaign.id },
  data: {
    spent: newSpent  // Incremented with earnings
  }
})

if (newSpent >= campaignBudget) {
  await tx.campaign.update({
    where: { id: campaign.id },
    data: {
      status: 'COMPLETED',
      completedAt: new Date()
    }
  })
}
```

---

### 4. User Total Earnings & Views Update ✅
**Location:** `lib/view-tracking-service.ts` (lines 174-185)

**Flow:**
1. When clip earns money, User.totalEarnings increments
2. When clip gains views, User.totalViews increments
3. Updates happen in same transaction as clip earnings

**Code:**
```typescript
await tx.user.update({
  where: { id: clip.userId },
  data: {
    totalEarnings: {
      increment: earningsToAdd  // Add new earnings
    },
    totalViews: {
      increment: viewsGained  // Add new views
    }
  }
})
```

---

### 5. Available Balance Calculation ✅
**Location:** `app/api/clippers/dashboard/route.ts` (lines 220-225)

**Logic:**
- Only counts earnings from **COMPLETED campaigns**
- Ensures clippers can only request payouts for finalized earnings
- Prevents payouts from active/incomplete campaigns

**Code:**
```typescript
const availableBalance = userData.clipSubmissions
  .filter(s => s.status === 'APPROVED' && s.campaigns.status === 'COMPLETED')
  .reduce((sum, submission) => {
    return sum + Number(submission.clips?.earnings || 0)
  }, 0)
```

---

### 6. Campaign Progress Bar ✅
**Location:** `app/clippers/dashboard/campaigns/page.tsx` (lines 176, 299)

**Display:**
- Shows `spent / budget` ratio
- Visual progress bar fills as budget is used
- Text shows remaining budget

**Code:**
```typescript
const progress = getProgressPercentage(campaign.spent, campaign.budget)
// Progress bar shows: "$450 / $500" with 90% fill
```

---

### 7. Payout Request System ✅

#### Clipper Side
**Location:** `app/api/clippers/payout-request/route.ts`

**Requirements:**
- Minimum $20
- Must have available balance
- Only from completed campaigns

**Code:**
```typescript
const availableBalance = dbUser.clipSubmissions
  .filter(s => s.status === 'APPROVED' && s.campaigns.status === 'COMPLETED')
  .reduce((sum, s) => sum + Number(s.clips?.earnings || 0), 0)

if (validatedData.amount > availableBalance) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: "Insufficient balance" 
  }, { status: 400 })
}
```

#### Admin Side
**Location:** `app/api/admin/payout-requests/[id]/process/route.ts`

**Actions:**
- Approve/Reject requests
- Mark as completed when paid
- Updates user's totalEarnings
- Creates Payout record

## Complete Data Flow

```
1. SUBMISSION
   ├─> Scrape initial views (e.g., 100)
   ├─> Store in ClipSubmission.initialViews
   └─> Status: PENDING

2. ADMIN APPROVAL
   ├─> Create Clip record
   ├─> Link ClipSubmission.clipId
   └─> Status: APPROVED

3. CRON JOB (every 4-8 hours)
   ├─> Scrape current views (e.g., 5,100)
   ├─> Calculate view growth: 5,100 - 100 = 5,000
   ├─> Calculate earnings: (5,000 / 1,000) × $10 = $50
   ├─> UPDATE in transaction:
   │   ├─> Clip.earnings += $50
   │   ├─> User.totalEarnings += $50
   │   ├─> User.totalViews += 5,000
   │   └─> Campaign.spent += $50
   └─> If Campaign.spent >= Campaign.budget:
       └─> Campaign.status = 'COMPLETED'

4. CAMPAIGN COMPLETION
   ├─> ClipSubmission.finalEarnings = Clip.earnings (snapshot)
   └─> Earnings now in "available balance"

5. PAYOUT REQUEST
   ├─> Clipper requests payout (min $20)
   ├─> Only from completed campaigns
   └─> Creates PayoutRequest record

6. ADMIN FULFILLMENT
   ├─> Admin marks request as COMPLETED
   ├─> Creates Payout record
   └─> User gets paid
```

## Dashboard Display Accuracy

### Clipper Dashboard
✅ **Total Earned**: Shows `User.totalEarnings`  
✅ **Available Balance**: Shows earnings from completed campaigns only  
✅ **Total Views**: Shows `User.totalViews`  
✅ **Clip Earnings**: Shows `Clip.earnings` (not deprecated `submission.payout`)  
✅ **View Change**: Shows `(+XXX)` growth since submission  

### Admin Dashboard
✅ **Campaign Progress**: Shows `spent / budget` with visual bar  
✅ **Submission Views**: Shows current views with growth indicator  
✅ **Submission Earnings**: Shows clip earnings  
✅ **Payout Requests**: Lists all pending requests with amounts

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Submit a clip and verify initialViews is captured
- [ ] Run cron job and verify earnings calculation
- [ ] Check campaign progress bar updates
- [ ] Verify clipper dashboard shows correct totals
- [ ] Complete a campaign and verify available balance appears
