# Browser Automation Alternatives for Vercel

## Current Issue: Chrome/Chromium Installation
Vercel serverless functions don't have Chrome pre-installed, which causes Puppeteer to fail.

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Use Chrome for Testing Service
External service that provides Chrome browser API:
- **Browserless.io**: Managed Chrome in the cloud
- **ScrapingBee**: Browser automation API
- **Bright Data**: Scraping infrastructure

### Option 2: Vercel Edge Functions + External Browser
- Use Vercel Edge Functions
- Connect to external browser service
- More reliable for production

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment Platform
Platforms that support browser automation:
- **Railway**: Full Node.js support with Chrome
- **Render**: Native Puppeteer support
- **DigitalOcean Apps**: Container-based deployment
- **AWS Lambda**: With Chrome layer

### Option 4: Test with Manual Verification First
While we solve the browser issue:
- Use the manual verification endpoints
- Test with API verification where available
- Implement browser automation locally first

## Recommended Immediate Approach:

1. **Use test mode** for immediate verification testing
2. **Set up external browser service** for production
3. **Keep manual verification** as fallback

## Quick Test Commands:

```bash
# Test with manual mode (works now)
curl -X POST https://www.swivimedia.com/api/social-verification/verify-simple \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"platform": "twitter", "username": "elonmusk"}'

# Test with bypass mode (works now)  
curl -X POST https://www.swivimedia.com/api/social-verification/verify-test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"platform": "twitter", "username": "test", "testMode": true}'
```

The browser agent approach is perfect, we just need to solve the Chrome installation on Vercel.
