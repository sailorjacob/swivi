## 🔥 The $863 Problem Explained

**What happened:**
- Your clips earned $2,449 total (this is correct and stored in `Clip.earnings`)
- But `Campaign.spent` only shows $1,586
- The cron job updates `Campaign.spent` incrementally
- Some updates were missed or failed
- Result: $863 discrepancy

**The fix:**
`sync-campaign-spend.js` recalculates `Campaign.spent` by summing all actual clip earnings.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Your earnings ($2,449) are safe and correct** - this just fixes the display
2. **Always backup before running scripts** - though these are non-destructive
3. **The code changes are already deployed** - scripts just sync the data
4. **This is a one-time fix** - data will stay consistent after running

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

```bash
# Restore from backup
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup_TIMESTAMP.sql
```
