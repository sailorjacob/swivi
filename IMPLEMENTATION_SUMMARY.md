# Complete View Tracking & Payout System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

A fully integrated view tracking, earnings calculation, and payout system has been successfully implemented. This system automatically tracks video views across 4 major platforms, calculates earnings based on view growth, enforces campaign budgets, and enables clippers to request payouts.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

**New Model:**
```prisma
model PayoutRequest {
  id              String              @id @default(cuid())
  userId          String
  amount          Decimal             @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  status          PayoutRequestStatus @default(PENDING)
  paymentMethod   PayoutMethod?
  paymentDetails  String?
  transactionId   String?
  payoutId        String?
  // ... timestamps and relations
}
```

**Enhanced Fields:**
- `ClipSubmission.initialViews` - Baseline views at approval (critical for earnings calculation)
- `ClipSubmission.finalEarnings` - Snapshot when campaign completes
- **Database Indexes:**
  - `view_tracking(clipId, date)` - Faster view lookups
  - `clip_submissions(campaignId, status)` - Optimized queries

**New Enums:**
- `PayoutRequestStatus` - PENDING, APPROVED, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, REJECTED, CANCELLED
- `NotificationType.PAYOUT_REQUESTED` - New notification type

### 2. Unified View Tracking Service ✅

**File:** `lib/view-tracking-service.ts` (consolidated from 2 services)

**Key Methods:**
- `trackClipViews(clipId)` - Main tracking logic with earnings calculation
- `processViewTracking(limit)` - Batch process for cron jobs
- `getClipsNeedingTracking()` - Find active clips to track
- `getCampaignViewStats()` - Campaign analytics
- `notifyCampaignCompletion()` - Notify on completion

**Features:**
- Multi-platform scraping (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter)
- Automatic earnings calculation: `(currentViews - initialViews) / 1000 * payoutRate`
- Budget enforcement: `min(earnings, remainingBudget)`
- Atomic database transactions
- Campaign auto-completion
- Clipper notifications

**Removed:**
- `lib/view-tracking.ts` - Merged into unified service

### 3. Integrated Cron Job ✅

**File:** `app/api/cron/view-tracking/route.ts`

**Schedule:** Every 4 hours (configured in `vercel.json`)

**Process Flow:**
1. Security check (Vercel cron authentication)
2. Initialize ViewTrackingService
3. Get active clips needing tracking (up to 50 per run)
4. For each clip:
   - Scrape current view count
   - Calculate earnings from view growth
   - Check budget remaining
   - Update clip, user, and campaign
   - Complete campaign if budget reached
5. Log results and errors
6. Return summary statistics

**Output Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "duration": "15234ms",
  "stats": {
    "processed": 45,
    "successful": 43,
    "failed": 2,
    "earningsAdded": "$127.50",
    "campaignsCompleted": 2
  }
}
```

### 4. Clip Creation Service Enhancement ✅

**File:** `lib/clip-creation-service.ts`

**Updated:** Submission approval now sets `initialViews`

```typescript
await prisma.clipSubmission.update({
  data: {
    clipId: clip.id,
    status: 'APPROVED',
    initialViews: BigInt(scrapedData.views || 0), // NEW
    rejectionReason: null
  }
})
```

This is critical - initialViews is the baseline for all earnings calculations.

### 5. Payout Request System ✅

**API Endpoints:**

**`POST /api/clippers/payout-request`** - Create payout request
- Validates $20 minimum
- Checks available balance (completed campaigns only)
- Prevents duplicate requests
- Notifies admins

**`GET /api/clippers/payout-request`** - List user's requests
- Shows all past requests
- Status tracking

**`GET /api/admin/payout-requests`** - List all requests (admin)
- Filter by status
- Include user details
- Sortable by date

**`POST /api/admin/payout-requests/[id]/process`** - Process request (admin)
- Actions: approve, reject, complete
- Transaction ID tracking
- Automatic balance deduction
- Clip earnings reset
- Notification system

### 6. Admin Payout UI ✅

**File:** `app/admin/payouts/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Dashboard with stats (Pending, Processing, Completed, Rejected)
- Tabbed interface for filtering
- Detailed request information
- User balance display
- Process dialog with:
  - Approve/Reject buttons
  - Transaction ID input
  - Notes field
  - Complete payment workflow

**Navigation:** Added to `app/admin/layout.tsx` as "Payout Management"

### 7. Clipper Dashboard Enhancement ✅

**File:** `app/clippers/dashboard/page.tsx`

**New Features:**
- **Available Balance Card:**
  - Shows earnings from completed campaigns
  - Green gradient design
  - Request button (enabled at $20+)
  - Total earnings display

- **Payout Request Dialog:**
  - Amount input (pre-filled with available balance)
  - Payment method selector (PayPal, Bank, Stripe)
  - Payment details input
  - Real-time validation
  - Success notifications

**Updated API:** Dashboard now returns `availableBalance` and `totalEarnings`

### 8. Campaign Completion Logic ✅

**Location:** Integrated in `lib/view-tracking-service.ts`

**Triggers:**
- Campaign.spent >= Campaign.budget
- Automatic check during view tracking
- Manual admin completion option

**On Completion:**
1. Set campaign.status = 'COMPLETED'
2. Set campaign.completedAt = now
3. Set campaign.completionReason
4. Snapshot finalEarnings for all submissions
5. Send notifications to all clippers
6. Stop tracking views for campaign

## How It Works

### Earnings Calculation Flow

```
1. Submission Created
   ├─ clipUrl: "https://tiktok.com/..."
   ├─ status: PENDING
   └─ initialViews: null

2. Admin Approves
   ├─ Scrape current views → 1,000
   ├─ Create Clip record
   ├─ Set initialViews = 1,000
   └─ status: APPROVED

3. Cron Runs (4 hours later)
   ├─ Scrape again → 5,000 views
   ├─ View growth = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000
   ├─ Campaign rate = $10 per 1K views
   ├─ Earnings = (4,000 / 1,000) * $10 = $40
   ├─ Check budget: remaining = $100 - $50 = $50
   ├─ Add earnings: min($40, $50) = $40
   ├─ Update:
   │  ├─ clip.earnings += $40
   │  ├─ user.totalEarnings += $40
   │  └─ campaign.spent += $40
   └─ New spent: $90

4. Cron Runs Again (4 hours later)
   ├─ Scrape → 6,500 views
   ├─ Growth from initial = 6,500 - 1,000 = 5,500
   ├─ Total earnings should be = (5,500 / 1,000) * $10 = $55
   ├─ Current earnings = $40
   ├─ Delta = $55 - $40 = $15
   ├─ Remaining budget = $100 - $90 = $10
   ├─ Add: min($15, $10) = $10 (CAPPED!)
   ├─ Update spent = $100
   ├─ Budget reached!
   ├─ Complete campaign
   ├─ Set finalEarnings = $50 (for this clip)
   └─ Notify clipper

5. Campaign Completed
   ├─ No more tracking
   ├─ Clipper can request payout
   └─ Earnings frozen at $50
```

### Payout Request Flow

```
1. Clipper Views Dashboard
   ├─ Available balance: $50 (from completed campaign)
   ├─ Request button: ENABLED (>= $20)
   └─ Clicks "Request Payout"

2. Payout Dialog Opens
   ├─ Amount: $50 (pre-filled)
   ├─ Method: PayPal
   ├─ Details: user@email.com
   └─ Submits request

3. System Creates PayoutRequest
   ├─ status: PENDING
   ├─ Notifies all admins
   └─ Notifies clipper (confirmation)

4. Admin Reviews
   ├─ Goes to /admin/payouts
   ├─ Sees request in "Pending" tab
   ├─ Clicks "Process"
   └─ Approves request

5. Admin Sends Payment
   ├─ Uses PayPal to send $50
   ├─ Gets transaction ID: TXN123456
   ├─ Returns to platform
   ├─ Enters transaction ID
   └─ Marks as "Complete"

6. System Processes Completion
   ├─ Updates PayoutRequest.status = COMPLETED
   ├─ Creates Payout record
   ├─ Deducts from user.totalEarnings: $50 → $0
   ├─ Resets clip.earnings = 0 (for completed campaigns)
   ├─ Links payout to request
   └─ Notifies clipper (payment sent)

7. Clipper Receives Notification
   ├─ "Your payout of $50 has been sent!"
   ├─ Transaction ID shown
   └─ Balance updated in dashboard
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Create Test Campaign:**
   - Budget: $100
   - Payout Rate: $10 per 1K views
   - Status: ACTIVE

2. **Submit Test Clips:**
   - Use real video URLs (easier to track)
   - Mix of platforms (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter)
   - 5+ submissions from different accounts

3. **Approve Submissions:**
   - Verify initialViews set correctly
   - Check clip records created
   - Confirm view tracking records created

4. **Trigger Cron Job:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/cron/view-tracking
   ```
   Or wait 4 hours for automatic run

5. **Monitor Results:**
   - Check clip.earnings increasing
   - Verify user.totalEarnings updating
   - Watch campaign.spent approaching budget
   - Confirm budget enforcement at limit

6. **Test Payout Flow:**
   - Request payout as clipper
   - Approve as admin
   - Complete with transaction ID
   - Verify balance updates

### Manual Database Checks

```sql
-- View all tracking for a clip
SELECT date, views, platform 
FROM view_tracking 
WHERE clip_id = 'YOUR_CLIP_ID' 
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Check earnings calculation
SELECT 
  cs.initial_views,
  c.views AS current_views,
  c.views - cs.initial_views AS growth,
  c.earnings,
  camp.payout_rate,
  (c.views - cs.initial_views) / 1000.0 * camp.payout_rate AS expected_earnings
FROM clip_submissions cs
JOIN clips c ON cs.clip_id = c.id
JOIN campaigns camp ON cs.campaign_id = camp.id
WHERE cs.id = 'YOUR_SUBMISSION_ID';

-- Campaign budget status
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  budget,
  spent,
  (spent / budget * 100) AS utilization_pct,
  status
FROM campaigns 
WHERE id = 'YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID';
```
