# Data Consistency Fix - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Your profile at `/clippers/dashboard/profile` was showing:
- ❌ **Total Views**: 6,153,896 (incorrect - old cached data)
- ✅ **Total Earnings**: $2,960.79 (correct)
- ❌ **Member Since**: Invalid Date

The dashboard showed different view counts, causing confusion about data accuracy.

## 🔧 What We Did

### 1. Updated Profile API ✅
**File**: `app/api/user/profile/route.ts`

Changed the profile API to calculate real-time values from actual clip data instead of using cached User table fields. Now it matches the dashboard exactly.

### 2. Fixed Invalid Date ✅
**File**: `app/clippers/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`

Added proper date validation to show formatted dates or "N/A" instead of "Invalid Date".

### 3. Created Recalculation Tools ✅

**Created 3 new scripts**:
1. `scripts/recalculate-user-totals.sql` - SQL to fix User table
2. `scripts/recalculate-user-totals.js` - Interactive Node.js script
3. `scripts/verify-campaign-spend.js` - Verify campaign accuracy

## 🚀 How to Fix Your Data (4 Steps)

### Step 1: Backup Database
```bash
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

### Step 2: Fix User Totals
```bash
# Preview what will change (safe, no modifications)
node scripts/recalculate-user-totals.js --dry-run

# Apply the fix
node scripts/recalculate-user-totals.js
```

### Step 3: Sync Campaign Spend ⚠️ IMPORTANT!
```bash
# Check for campaign spend discrepancies
node scripts/sync-campaign-spend.js --dry-run

# Fix campaign spend to match actual clip earnings
node scripts/sync-campaign-spend.js
```

### Step 4: Verify Campaign Data
```bash
# Double-check campaign spend accuracy
node scripts/verify-campaign-spend.js

# Fix any remaining issues
node scripts/verify-campaign-spend.js --fix
```

## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: Will this fix affect my earnings?**  
A: No, your actual earnings are safe and accurate. This only fixes the display of cached values in the User table.

**Q: Is this a one-time fix or ongoing issue?**  
A: One-time fix. After deploying the code changes and running the script, data will stay consistent automatically.

**Q: What if I'm worried about running the scripts?**  
A: Run with `--dry-run` first to see what would change without making any modifications. Always backup first!

**Q: Will this affect other users?**  
A: The Node.js script recalculates for all users. Each user's cached totals will be updated to match their actual clip data.

**Q: How long does it take?**  
A: The script processes ~10-50 users per second. For most databases, it completes in under a minute.
