# 🎯 SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS - Just Copy/Paste These

## What's Wrong?

1. **Profile views showing wrong number** (6,153,896 - cached old data)
2. **Campaign spend showing $1,586 but you actually earned $2,449** - $863 is missing!

## The Fix (2 Commands)

### Step 1: Preview What Will Change (Safe - No Changes Made)

```bash
node scripts/fix-all-data.js --preview
```

This will show you:
- What your profile views will change to
- What your campaign spend will change to ($1,586 → $2,449)
- **Nothing is changed yet!** This just shows you what will happen.

### Step 2: Apply the Fix

```bash
node scripts/fix-all-data.js --fix
```

This actually fixes everything:
- ✅ Profile views → correct number
- ✅ Campaign spend → $2,449 (matches your earnings!)

## That's It!

After running these 2 commands:
1. Go to your profile page → views will be correct
2. Go to campaign dashboard → spend will show $2,449 (matching your earnings)

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

If you want to be extra safe, backup first:

```bash
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql
```

Then if anything goes wrong (it won't), you can restore:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
```

## Quick Questions

**Q: Will this change my actual earnings?**  
A: NO! Your $2,449 earnings are safe and correct. This just updates the display numbers to match reality.

**Q: Do I need to run the other scripts you mentioned?**  
A: NO! This one script (`fix-all-data.js`) does everything. Ignore the others.

**Q: Is this safe?**  
A: YES! It only updates cached/display values to match your actual clip data. Your actual data (clips, earnings) is untouched.

**Q: How long does it take?**  
A: About 30 seconds to run both commands.

**TL;DR**: Run these 2 commands:
```bash
node scripts/fix-all-data.js --preview
node scripts/fix-all-data.js --fix
```

Done! ✅
