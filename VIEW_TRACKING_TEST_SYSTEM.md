## Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Submit Test URLs
1. Go to the "Submit URLs" tab
2. Enter a video URL from any supported platform
3. Select the correct platform
4. Click "Create Test Clip"

### Step 2: Track Views Over Time
1. Go to the "Track Views" tab
2. Select a test clip from the dropdown
3. Click "Track Views Now" to scrape current view count
4. Wait a few hours/days and track again to see growth

### Step 3: Monitor Statistics
1. Go to the "View Stats" tab
2. Select a clip and click "Get Stats"
3. Click "Calculate Earnings" to test payment calculations
4. View tracking history to see growth over time

### Step 4: Test Cron Jobs
1. Go to the "Cron Testing" tab
2. Click "Test Cron Job System"
3. Check results to ensure systems are working

## Data Management

- **Test clips** are marked with "Test Clip" in the title for easy identification
- **Deletion** is restricted to test clips only (safety measure)
- **Data cleanup** - test clips and their tracking data are deleted together
- **User isolation** - users can only see their own test clips

## Cron Job Information

### Scheduled Jobs (run every 4 hours):
- **View Tracking**: Scrapes current view counts for all active clips
- **Payout Calculation**: Calculates earnings based on view growth
- **Campaign Completion**: Checks if campaigns have reached goals

### Manual Testing:
- Use the "Test Cron Job System" button to manually trigger these processes
- Real cron jobs run automatically on Vercel every 4 hours

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ **Green checkmarks** in tracking results
‚úÖ **Increasing view counts** over time
‚úÖ **Successful scraping** without errors
‚úÖ **Accurate earnings calculations**
‚úÖ **Consistent results** over multiple days

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Scraping Errors**: Check console for Apify API errors or rate limiting
2. **No View Growth**: Some videos may not be publicly accessible or have stable view counts
3. **Database Issues**: Verify data is being saved to `view_tracking` table
4. **Rate Limiting**: Apify has rate limits - test gradually

### Debug Information:
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Use the existing debug tools at `/debug/view-tracking-test`
- Monitor the cron job results for system-wide issues

## Security

- **Authentication required** for all endpoints
- **Role-based access** (admin and clipper users)
- **User data isolation** - users only see their own test clips
- **Safe deletion** - only test clips can be deleted
- **Rate limiting** protection through existing API patterns

## Integration

This test system integrates with:
- Existing view tracking services (`ViewTrackingService`)
- Database schema (clips, view_tracking tables)
- Authentication system (Supabase)
- UI components (shadcn/ui)
- Scraping services (Apify integration)

The system is designed to be non-disruptive and can be safely removed if needed.
