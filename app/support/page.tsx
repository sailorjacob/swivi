                      Payments are sent within one week after the campaign finishes, often quicker. Throughout the campaign, we regularly review and approve clips. Once the campaign budget is fully spent, we finalize who gets paid and how much. You will receive an email notification once the payment has been sent.

                      All clips must have a minimum of 0.5% engagement rate to qualify for campaigns. Any video with less than 0.5% engagement rate will not be eligible for payout. We lowered the requirement from 1% to 0.5% so more clips can qualify, while still keeping a fair standard for quality and performance.

Here, you can either click "scan account" to automatically fetch your recent clips, or manually submit the links by clicking "submit clips." Make sure you submit clips regularly because we close campaigns when the budget is almost reached to avoid overspending.
